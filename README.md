- 👋 Hiya, I’m Caitee.

- 👀 I’m working towards becoming Full-Stack and/or a Software Engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
 - Java
 - JavaScript
 - Statistics
 - Information Systems

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything challenging but beginner-friendly, Java-related, or a new language.
- 🏂 I love to learn, hike, snowboard, rock climb, drive my WRX STI, and travel.
